# Misp Setup

Now heres the stitch on how to set up your misp file
- First you will need to cd into the misp directory underneath honeytraps or rather

    cd ~/Honeypot-Project/honeytraps/misp
- There you will read the README.md file and follow the instructions exactly as told
- It will essentially have you create an env file with certain parameters
- Afterwards you will run the following commands in order to get your misp site up and running

./setup_misp.sh
./run_misp.sh

- You will need sudo privileges in order to run these commands
- After these have been set up follow the README.md instructions and open a http://localhost and enter the credentials given in the README.md
- It should look like this after it has been setup
